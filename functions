FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON
it is divided into 2 types function call and function defenition
we can change arguments name in function def but not in function call
return-go back to function call
def hello(a,b):  #fucntion def
    print(a)
a=10
b=20
first function is called and then it is defined
hello(a,b)  #function call 
output-10
